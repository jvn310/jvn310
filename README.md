# 🌟 Hey there! I'm Tumelo Phatlane

Welcome to my coding universe! I'm a tech enthusiast and lifelong learner from South Africa, driven by curiosity and a deep love for all things tech. 🚀
While I’m still exploring the vast world of software development, I’m diving into different technologies, from backend systems to web development and constantly challenging myself to grow. 💻✨
Whether it’s crafting responsive websites, building interactive apps, or experimenting with databases, I’m always up for learning something new.
I believe in the power of technology to shape the future, and I’m on an exciting journey to find my place in it. 🌍💡
Feel free to follow along as I continue exploring, experimenting, and expanding my knowledge one line of code at a time.
